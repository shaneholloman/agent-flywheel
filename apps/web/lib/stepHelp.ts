      "This just affects which terminal instructions you see — you can change it later.",

        symptom: "ssh-keygen: command not found",

      {
        symptom: "I entered my IP but can't continue",
        solution:
          "Make sure you're entering the IPv4 address (looks like 123.45.67.89), not a hostname. Check your VPS provider's dashboard for the IP.",
      },

        symptom: "Connection timed out",

        symptom: "Cannot reach github.com",
        solution:
          "Check your VPS network: try 'ping 8.8.8.8'. If that works but github.com doesn't, try 'echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf'.",

        solution:

      },
      {
        symptom: "SSH connection dropped during install",
        solution:
          "Reconnect via SSH and re-run the installer. It's safe to run multiple times — it skips already-installed components.",

        symptom: "Permission denied errors during install",

    tips: [
      "The installer is safe to run multiple times — it won't break anything.",
