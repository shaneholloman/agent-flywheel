    short: "Virtual Private Server, a remote computer you rent by the hour",
    long: "A VPS is like renting a computer that lives in a data center somewhere in the world. You connect to it over the internet and control it as if you were sitting right in front of it. Unlike your laptop, it's always on, always connected, and you have full administrator access. Companies like DigitalOcean, Hetzner, and Linode rent these out starting around $5-20/month.",
    analogy: "Think of it like renting an apartment instead of buying a house. You get your own private space (the server) inside a big building (the data center). Someone else handles the electricity, internet, and physical maintenance while you just use it.",
    why: "We use a VPS because AI coding agents work best with lots of CPU power, memory, and a stable internet connection. Your laptop could work, but a VPS gives you a dedicated workspace that stays running even when your laptop is closed.",

    term: "Cloud Server",
    short: "A computer running 24/7 in a data center that you access remotely",
    long: "A cloud server is essentially a VPS, a virtual computer running in a data center. You never see the physical hardware; you just connect to it over the internet. These servers are called 'cloud' because they seem to exist 'somewhere out there' rather than on your desk. Major providers include AWS (Amazon), Google Cloud, Azure (Microsoft), DigitalOcean, and Hetzner.",
    analogy: "Imagine renting a really powerful computer that lives in a building with perfect electricity, super-fast internet, and 24/7 security guards. You can access it from anywhere in the world using just your laptop and an internet connection.",

When you 'SSH into your VPS,' you're opening an encrypted connection that lets you type commands as if you were sitting at that computer. Everything you type is encrypted, so nobody can spy on what you're doing, not even your internet provider.",
    analogy: "Imagine a secret, soundproof phone line between you and your VPS. When you pick up the phone (SSH), you can talk directly to your remote computer. Nobody can eavesdrop, and you can give it commands as if you were right there.",
    why: "SSH is the secure way to access remote servers. It's been the industry standard for over 25 years because it's simple, reliable, and incredibly secure. Every system administrator and developer uses it daily.",

    term: "Terminal",
    short: "A text-based interface to control your computer by typing commands",
    long: "The terminal (also called command line, console, or shell) is a way to control your computer by typing text commands instead of clicking icons. It might look intimidating at first with just a blinking cursor waiting for input, but it's actually incredibly powerful. Most professional developers spend significant time in the terminal because it's faster and more precise than clicking through menus.",
    analogy: "Instead of pointing and clicking, you're texting your computer. You type what you want ('show me all my files'), press Enter, and it does it. It's like having a conversation with your computer in a very specific language.",
    why: "AI coding agents work primarily through the terminal because it's the most direct way to tell a computer what to do. Commands are precise, repeatable, and can be automated, which is exactly what AI agents need.",

    long: "curl is a command-line tool that fetches content from URLs, like a text-based web browser. When you see 'curl ... | bash', it means: download a script from the internet and immediately run it. It's a common pattern for one-line installers. For example, 'curl https://example.com/install.sh | bash' downloads the install script and runs it in one step.",
    analogy: "It's like right-clicking a link and choosing 'Save As...' but without the clicking. You just tell it the URL and it fetches the content for you.",

When you type 'ls' to list files, bash is what understands that command and executes it. It's the default shell on most Linux systems and macOS (though Mac now defaults to zsh). Beyond running commands, bash also lets you write scripts, which are files full of commands that run automatically.",
    analogy: "Bash is like a translator between you and your computer. You speak in human-readable commands, and bash converts them into actions the computer understands.",

Most commands that work in bash also work in zsh, so you're not learning a new language, just getting a nicer experience.",
    analogy: "If bash is a reliable Honda Civic, zsh is a Tesla. Same basic purpose (driving/running commands), but with lots of smart features that make the experience much more pleasant.",

It can show: current directory, git branch and status, Python/Node version, command execution time, background jobs, and much more, all color-coded and with icons. Despite showing all this info, it's designed to be extremely fast (instant prompt).",
    analogy: "It's like a dashboard for your terminal. Instead of a plain blinking cursor, you get a heads-up display showing everything relevant about your current state.",
    why: "At a glance, you can see which git branch you're on, whether you have uncommitted changes, how long your last command took, and more. This context awareness makes development faster.",

  cli: {
    term: "CLI",
    short: "Command Line Interface, programs you control by typing commands",
    long: "A CLI (Command Line Interface) is any program you interact with by typing commands rather than clicking buttons. Examples: 'git' (version control), 'npm' (package management), 'docker' (containers). CLI tools are popular with developers because they're scriptable (you can automate them), precise (exact commands, exact results), and fast (no waiting for graphics to load).",
    analogy: "If a GUI (graphical interface) is like driving with a steering wheel and pedals, a CLI is like typing exact coordinates to a self-driving car. More precise, more automatable, but requires learning the commands.",

    long: "tmux lets you split your terminal into multiple panes and windows, and critically, keeps everything running even if you disconnect. You can have one pane running a server, another for editing, and a third for logs. If your internet drops or you close your laptop, tmux keeps everything running. When you reconnect, it's all still there exactly as you left it.",
    analogy: "Imagine browser tabs, but for your terminal. And unlike browser tabs, they keep running even when you close the browser (or lose your internet connection).",
    why: "For AI agents, tmux is essential. We can have multiple agents running in different panes, monitor their progress, and never worry about losing work if the connection drops. It's the cockpit for managing agentic workflows.",

If something breaks, you can go back to any previous version. Git also enables collaboration: multiple people can work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work. It's used by virtually every software company.",
    analogy: "Imagine 'undo' on steroids. Every save is remembered forever, you can name your saves ('Fixed login bug'), compare any two versions, and branch off to try experiments without affecting the main code.",

Instead of memorizing Git commands, you see everything and use keyboard shortcuts. Press 's' to stage a file, 'c' to commit, 'space' to toggle. It makes Git visual and fast without leaving the terminal.",
    analogy: "If Git commands are like typing GPS coordinates, lazygit is like a visual map where you can see and click on where you want to go.",

    short: "Lightning-fast code search that finds text across thousands of files instantly",
    long: "ripgrep (command: 'rg') searches through files incredibly fast. It's like grep or Ctrl+F, but for your entire codebase. It automatically ignores files in .gitignore, searches recursively, shows line numbers and context, and can handle massive codebases. Finding 'TODO' across 10,000 files? Takes milliseconds.",
    analogy: "It's like having Sherlock Holmes with super-speed searching through every file in your project. You describe what you're looking for, and instantly get all matches with context.",

Works with files, command history, git branches, and anything else you pipe into it. The 'fuzzy' part means it matches even if your characters aren't consecutive.",
    analogy: "Like autocomplete, but smarter. Type 'foo' and it finds 'my-foobar-file.txt', 'config-food.json', anything with those letters in that order.",

  zoxide: {
    term: "zoxide",
    short: "Smart directory navigation that lets you jump to any folder by typing a few letters",
    long: "zoxide learns which directories you visit frequently and lets you jump to them instantly. Instead of 'cd /very/long/path/to/my/project', just type 'z project'. It uses 'frecency' (frequency + recency) to rank directories, so your recent and frequent folders are always one command away.",
    analogy: "Like browser bookmarks that write themselves. Visit a folder a few times and zoxide remembers it. Then jump there from anywhere with just a few keystrokes.",
    why: "Navigating file systems is surprisingly time-consuming. zoxide eliminates the need to remember or type full paths; just jump directly to where you want to be.",

It records every command with context (directory, exit code, duration), syncs across machines, and provides a beautiful UI to search your history. Forgot that docker command from last month? Search for 'docker' and find it, even if you ran it on a different computer.",
    analogy: "Your terminal commands become like Google search history: fully searchable, synced everywhere, with the full context of when and where you ran them.",

    term: "lsd",
    short: "Modern 'ls' with colors, icons, and better formatting",
    long: "lsd is a modern replacement for the 'ls' command (which lists files). It adds colors to distinguish file types, icons for visual recognition, tree views, git status indicators, and smart formatting. Instead of a wall of text, you get a beautiful, scannable view of your files.",
    analogy: "If 'ls' shows you a plain text list, lsd shows you the same information but color-coded and organized like a nice file manager.",

  direnv: {
    term: "direnv",
    short: "Automatic environment variables when you enter a directory",

Installing a Python project's dependencies that took 2 minutes with pip takes 2 seconds with uv. It's fully compatible with existing Python projects.",
    analogy: "Like upgrading from a dial-up modem to fiber internet: same websites, but everything loads instantly.",

Many modern CLI tools (ripgrep, lsd, zoxide, fd) are written in Rust, which is why they're so fast. Rust is also used for performance-critical parts of web browsers, databases, and cloud infrastructure.",

Many cloud tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) are written in Go. It compiles to a single binary with no dependencies, making deployment simple.",
    analogy: "If Rust is a Swiss Army knife with 50 tools, Go is a really well-designed hammer. Fewer features, but exactly what you need for most jobs.",
