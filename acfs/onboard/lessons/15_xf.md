# What is XF?

**XF** provides blazingly fast full-text search across your personal X/Twitter archive: tweets, likes, DMs, and Grok conversations. All indexing and queries happen 100% locally.

Built with Tantivy and SQLite, it combines BM25 keyword matching with semantic similarity for hybrid search. Index at ~10,000 docs/second, query in sub-milliseconds.

---

# Who Needs This?

XF is useful if you:
- Want to find old conversations or references
- Are building datasets from your tweet history
- Need to search your social media presence quickly

This is an optional utility, not required for the agentic coding workflow.

# Basic Usage

First, index your archive (one-time setup):

```bash
xf index ~/Downloads/twitter-archive
```

Then search:

```bash
xf search "machine learning"
```

---

# Date Filtering

Search within a specific time period:

```bash
xf search "rust" --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-06-30
```

---

# Export Results

Output to JSON for further processing:

```bash
xf search "AI" --format json > results.json
```

1. **xf index** — Index your archive (once)
2. **xf search** — Query your tweets
3. **--from/--to** — Filter by date
